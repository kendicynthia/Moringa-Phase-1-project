My phase 1 project

**PHASE** **1** **PROJECT**.
1. **Overview**.

Microsoft is trying to venture into the movie industry due to the fact that other companies are creating original content. However, due to no prior experience whatsoever on how to do this,they ought to consult on how box office movies perfom and what genre to go into.

2. **Business** **Understanding**

 The box office is ideally a place or theatre where tickets are sold. However, it is also used to refer to the commercial success of a film, play or even actors in terms of the audience and how the movie performed. We will be looking at what makes a movie do well at the box office by taking a look at the data made available to us.We shall be answering the following questions;

 a.What genre should microsoft venture into based on profits generated?

 b.How does the movie runtime compare to its rating?

 c. Which actors and directors should they hire due to their ratings?

 d. How profitable movies have been throughout the years.

3. **Data** **Understanding**

 The data set the we will be using for this analysis will be from various movie sites such as: Box Office Mojo,IMDB, Rotten tomatoes,ThemovieDB and The Numbers. The data consists of the following files; bom.movie_gross.csv,movie_ratings,tmdb.movies.csvtn, movie_budgets.csv and im.db. The data consists of the following set of variables;
 Studio
Production Budget
Genres
Domestic and Foreign Gross Income
Average Movie Ratings
Number of Votes
Movie Runtime
Release Date
Popularity
Movie titles


4. **External Data Source Validation**
Making sure your data matches something outside of the dataset is very important. 
It allows you to ensure that the measurements are roughly in line with what they should be and it serves as a check on what other things might be wrong in your dataset. The purpose of this step is to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and relevance of the external data before integrating it into your analysis. 

## 5. Tidying the Dataset
This includes the following;
Checking for outliers
Checking for duplicates
Checking for Anomilies
Checking for missing data.
Once they are identified,we then clean our data set and move on to the next step.

## 6. Exploratory Analysis
In this step,we merged the data sets and looked at how they co-related. This was done using bar graphs and scatter plots to enable us to read our data correctly,come up with conclusions and reccomendations.

The above scatter plot gives us the following feedback;>Toy Story 3 has the lowest foreign gross income but highest domestic income, while Shrek Forever After has the lowest domestic income but the highest foreign income.Depending on the target ie domestic or foreign, this should be taken into consideration.                                                                 7. **Conclusions**
1. Drama genre happens to have the highest average rating,whilst the animation,action,comedy combo had the lowest average rating. This means that if Microsoft decides to into the movie industry, they should consider going into the drama genre which has the highest ratings. They may also consider doing the Animation,comedy,adventure combo as it also has the second highest ratings.
2. The more the runtime the higher the average rating.
3. The lower the domestic income, the higher the foreign gross and vice versa. This is seen in the Shrek forever after movie and toy story 3
